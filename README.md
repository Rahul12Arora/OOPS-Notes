# OOPS-Notes

<h2>Object</h2>

**An object is an instance of a class. It is a runtime entity that contains its own set of attributes (data members) and methods (functions) as defined in the class.
**</br>
**An Object is a real-world element in an object-oriented environment that may have physical or conceptual existence.**</br>

</br>

<h2>Object</h2>

**A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, which defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects of that class will have.**</br>

NOT REAL: Class is not a REAL THING; itâ€™s just a concept, actually the objects created from a class are real.
</br>
A single class can be used to create any number of instances or objects.

<h2>Static Vs Final Variables</h2>

In Java, both static and final are keywords used to declare variables with specific properties.</br>

A static variable is a class-level variable, which means that its value is shared across all instances of that class. It can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. When a variable is declared as static, it belongs to the class and not to any specific object of that class.</br>

On the other hand, a final variable is a constant variable whose value cannot be changed once it is initialized. A final variable can be initialized in the following ways:</br>

<ul>
Directly during declaration
  <li>In the constructor of the class</li>
  <li>In an instance initialization block</li>
  <li>In a static initialization block</li>
</ul>
