<h2>Object</h2>
**a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, which defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects of that class will have.**</br>
NOT REAL: Class is not a REAL THING; itâ€™s just a concept, actually the objects created from a class are real.
</br>
A single class can be used to create any number of instances or objects.
